[this is being written]

notes:
- default behavior of event handlers is to do nothing
- default behavior of event handlers that return bool is to do nothing but return false
- passing nil to an event handler set function restores default behavior
- only functions safe for calling outside Do() are Go(), Do(), and Stop()
