This is not a single-file example; both main.go and icons.go need to be built together. icons.go is a separate file because it contains the binary data for the icons. At some point in the future the file will not contain any package ui-related code (if it doesn't already), and will only be responsible for parsing the images and producing the structure for the embedded Table (if even).
