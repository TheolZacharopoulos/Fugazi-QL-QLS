- Add Boolean, Set
- Type checking
- Unique ID nodes in AST

The type checker detects:

    reference to undefined questions
    duplicate question declarations with different types
    conditions that are not of the type boolean
    operands of invalid type to operators
    cyclic dependencies between questions
    duplicate labels (warning)
