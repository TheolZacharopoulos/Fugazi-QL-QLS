Hi there, thank you for traveling with KevinRene. During your flight you're free to enjoy our delicious recycled beverages, meals made of roadkill, and some weird ass games.

In case of emergency please headbutt your neighbor, take a chill pill, and drop dat beat.

We hope you have a pleasant flight.
